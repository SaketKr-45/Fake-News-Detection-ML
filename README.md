# 📰 Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning

This project aims to detect fake news articles using various supervised machine learning algorithms. It utilizes the FakeNewsNet dataset and focuses on classifying news based on their titles.

## 🔍 Overview
- Preprocessed and vectorized text data using TF-IDF
- Implemented and compared 6 ML models:
  - Logistic Regression (Best, 91.6% Accuracy)
  - Naive Bayes
  - SVM
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
- Evaluated using Precision, Recall, F1-Score & Confusion Matrix


## 📊 Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- TF-IDF Vectorizer

## 📌 Future Work
- Deep learning with LSTM/BERT
- Use full news body instead of just titles
- Deploy as a web app using Flask
